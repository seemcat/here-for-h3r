## Inspiration
Abortion laws based on different state can be confusing and costly for women depends on which stage of pregnancy they are in and what state they live in. Many could be forced to travel far for abortion. We want to create a safe, secure Web3 solution to inform women of their options.

## What it does
Here for H3r is a mobile-friendly web app that enables users to sign in with a Web3 wallet, select a given state in the US (i.e. California) and view censorship resistant information, advice and best practices on safe abortion.

## How we built it
We built a censorship resistant on-chain database using NFTs stored on IPFS. The NFTs serve as data sources for providing safe abortion information relating to specific states within the US.

## Challenges we ran into
Because displaying the most important information for women was important for the UX, we did the research. We found that only some states in particular need their own unique data source (such as Texas and Wyoming), while the majority are grouped into restriction based categories and tagged with their applicable states as a meta data property. The latter enabled us to sort and display any relevant information in our UI relating to the selected state.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Did you know that a lower percentage of women vs men have Web3 wallets? 31% women vs. 69% men (via fumbi.network). This is why we're proud to build an NFT-based dapp that is not only going to support women, but also educate, inspire and onboard them to web3.

## What's next for Here for H3r
It would also be possible to mint new NFTs / data sources and display more information about each state, as well as dynamically update existing metadata to ensure the information displayed is up to date.

In addition, we can also partner with stakeholders and NGOs who wants to support women by airdroping funds, or POAPs for users of Here for H3r. These funds can help women travel, and the POAPs can grant them access to educational services.

As you can already imagine, with Here for H3r, there are endless of opportunities to support women's health, career, education, fitness, spirituality, and more.
